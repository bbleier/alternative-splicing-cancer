# Investigating Alternative Splicing and pmCiC in Cancer Metabolism

*Authors: Blake Bleier, Tyler Gustafson (Gustani)*

## Project Overview

This project investigates the role of alternative splicing in the over expression of the plasma membrane citrate transporter (pmCiC) and its contribution to the metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells. Using transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we explore how differential splicing patterns influence pmCiC expression and its potential impact on tumor progression.

Cancer cells rely on metabolic adaptations to support rapid growth, including the uptake of extracellular citrate through pmCiC. This research aims to analyze the prevalence of pmCiC, its splicing mechanisms, and its correlation with cancer subtypes, tumor grades, and survival outcomes.

## Key Objectives

1. **Analyze Differential Splicing Patterns**:
   - Compare pmCiC expression in primary tumors and matched normal tissues across cancer types.
   
2. **Subtype and Phenotypic Analysis**:
   - Investigate pmCiC expression across tissue subtypes and assess correlations with tumor stage and immune subtypes.

3. **Machine Learning Exploration**:
   - Demonstrate machine learning methodologies by attempting to predict tumor stage using pmCiC proportions and other phenotypic data.

## Data Source

This study leverages transcriptomic data from [**The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**](https://www.cancer.gov/tcga), a publicly available repository of cancer genomic data. For this analysis, we focused on approximately **8,000 solid tumor patient samples**, including both primary tumor and matched normal tissues, to investigate differential splicing patterns of the plasma membrane citrate transporter (pmCiC). 

Key features extracted include:
- **Isoform-Specific Gene Expression Data**: Normalized Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values for individual isoforms of the SLC25A1 gene, including pmCiC (plasma membrane citrate transporter) and mCiC (mitochondrial citrate transporter). 
- **Phenotypic and Clinical Metadata**: Information such as tumor stage, immune subtype, and disease-specific survival (DSS) to correlate molecular findings with clinical outcomes and cancer progression.
- **Tumor Purity Data**: Stromal and tumor cell purity estimates for tumor samples

## Key Findings

- Both pmCiC and mitochondrial citrate transporter (mCiC) are upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in cancer metabolism.
- Significant tissue-specific differences in pmCiC proportion were observed in lung and breast tissue types.
- Contrary to the initial hypothesis, higher pmCiC proportions were not associated with poorer survival, indicating a nuanced role for pmCiC in cancer progression.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and normalized TCGA data for exploratory and statistical analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examined distributions, correlations, and trends in pmCiC and related features.
3. **Statistical Framework**:
   - Assessed differential splicing and proportional expression patterns across tissue types.
4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Applied feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to explore predictive modeling.

## Next Steps

- Expand the dataset by integrating additional sources (e.g., ICGC, CCLE).
- Validate results with long-read sequencing to confirm relative presence and abundance of pmCiC and mCiC in breast/lung tissue
- Perform functional validation of pmCiC’s role in cancer metabolism using experimental approaches.
- Integrate with multiomics data to provide a more holistic view of pmCiC's role in cancer metabolism
